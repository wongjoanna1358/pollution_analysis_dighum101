### Abstract

Pollution, global warming, and many other environmental issues that our globe faces today lend a discerning discussion around the increasing presence of this situation and state.  Our earth‚Äôs ecosystems are gradually decaying and deteriorating due to the industrialization and technological advancements our society has experienced and continues to experience in the last centuries.  As the human population continues to flourish and practices continue to be done, there has been an increased amount of pollution and environmental crisis; more awareness is made and is needed to be made over these issues.  With this research problem, I focused on a data-driven question to generally focus my research on; what are the most common and relevant types of trash or pollution shown in the image annotations of the dataset?  In addition, a more conceptual question this project answers is about how image annotations of litter and trash can help us identify most common objects that we wrongly dispose of, and therefore, what objects have a greater impact on pollution as a whole.  Looking at two different datasets--TACO and Open Images--to ensure a wide variety of information/data intake and results.  By analyzing data through CSV file formats and visualizing ideas/content through word clouds, bar graphs, and dot plots, this projects enables me to answer the research question and build new ideas surrounding pollution.  From the gathered data, I found that most of our litter is of plastic objects (beit in bags, boxes, bottles, wrappers, films, etc.), and it is important to be conscious of our actions and how trash can have a greater impact on our environment and the pollution that destroys it.  Plastics have a negative effect on our world if not handled correctly; they can and have damaged our marine and natural ecosystems, impacting many other issues like global warming and climate change.
